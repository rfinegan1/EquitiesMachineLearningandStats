# EquitiesMachineLearningandStats
Simple Machine Learning and RSI Stochastic Algorithms for individual investing

The first cell is just to vizualize if the equity has been somewhat linear throughout 15 years.
The second cell is two functions to predict stock prices using sklearn and linear regression. 
The third cell is for calculating RSI. I used one to calculate RSI the normal way, and then in the 
myRSI function I did some things different by measuring the returns instead of just if the 
stock experienced a positive or negative daily return. In the fourth cell is the RSI Stochastic 
Oscillator which I use for my stock trading now. It's pretty cool to see how the stock goes from 
overbought to oversold in an oscillating manner. The last cell is using keras and sklearn to 
predict the next days stock price. I am still experimenting with that one and will update shortly.
